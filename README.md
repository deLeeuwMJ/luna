# Luna
A high-performance rhythm game built in C++ that uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for algorithmic level generation on arbitrary songs.
Gameplay is controlled via a custom-built, three-button hardware controller based on the STM32 microcontroller.

## Roadmap
Phase 1: DSP & File Generation (Level Creation)
- Goal: Successfully process an audio file and save a synchronized "object map.

Phase 2: Game Prototype (Visualization & Timing)
- Goal: Create a visual environment that can accurately read the object file and display the track.

Phase 3: Hardware & Connectivity
- Goal: Build the custom controller and establish robust, low-latency communication with the game.
